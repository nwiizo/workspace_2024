== Controller

This example shows a simple *Controller* which reacts on a certain annotation given on services.

This controller is the poor men's version of Fabric8's https://github.com/fabric8io/exposecontroller[expose-controller].
It watches the Kubernetes API for new `Service` and for each service with an annotation `expose=/path` it will create a new `Ingress` object for this service, matching on the given path.
If an ingress object already exists for this service, then nothing will be done.
Also, no ingress gets removed when a `Service` is removed.

For a full explanation of how this controller works, please refer to the "Controller" pattern in our book.
Note, that this is example is meant for educational purposes only and is not suitable for general purpose usage.

The easiest way to try this example is by using https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[minikube] with an ingress controller enabled:

[source, bash]
----
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress
----


The controller script itself is stored in a `ConfigMap` and can be easily edited later on:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create configmap expose-controller-script --from-file=./expose-controller.sh
----

In order to deploy the controlller a `Deployment` creates a pod with two containers:

* One Kubernetes API proxy which exposes the Kubernetes API on localhost with port 8001. The image for `k8spatterns/kubeapi-proxy` is defined in this link:../../images/kubeapi-proxy.dockerfile[Dockerfile].
* The main container which executes the script from the configmap. It is based on a single Alpine base image with https://curl.haxx.se/[curl] and https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] included. The Dockerfile for this image `k8spattern/curl-jq` can be found link:../../images/curl-jq.dockerfile[here].

To create this deployment just call:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f expose-controller.yml
----

You might want to have a look at the descriptor file; it contains some useful comments along the way.

That's all.
Now you have a nice little Controller which watches on `Services` and reacts based on given annotations.

To try it out, we are reusing the simple web application from the link:../../structural/Sidecar[Sidecar] example.
It is slightly modified as we are adding an annotation `expose: /mdn` and mount the git sync HTML files to an `mdn` directory so that the application serves these below a context `/mdn`.
Before applying the following descriptors, it is recommended to start a tail on the controller pod's log with `kubectl logs -f expose-controller-... expose-controller`.
This command will show the events received by the controller as they come in.

The create the web application itself:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f web-app.yml
----

To verify that indeed an ingress object is created, try:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get ingress web-app -o yaml
----

Finally, let's point our browser to the exposed ingress by


[source, bash]
----
open https://$(minikube ip)/mdn
----

(`open` works nicely on macOS, for other operating systems, just open manually the URL `https://$(minikube ip)/mdn`)



=== Docker Images

This example uses two straightforward Docker images which you can find in the subdirectories:

* link:../../images/curl-jq.dockerfile[k8spatterns/curl-jq] which is an https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/[alpine] Image with https://curl.haxx.se/[curl] and https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] added
* link:../../images/kubeapi-proxy.dockerfile[k8spatterns/kubeapi-proxy] is an alpine Linux with a local `kubectl` installed and `kubectl proxy` started with the proper CA and token mounted. The original version https://github.com/luksa/kubernetes-in-action/tree/master/Chapter08/kubectl-proxy[kubectl-proxy] is from https://github.com/luksa[Marko Luk≈°a] who introduced this proxy in his awesome book https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action[Kubernetes in Action]. Highly recommended!
