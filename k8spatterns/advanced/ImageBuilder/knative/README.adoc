== ImageBuilder - Knative build

This example demonstrates how to build images with https://github.com/knative/build[Knative build], starting from https://github.com/k8spatterns/random-generator[source] stored in a GitHub repository.

Two variations are offered, one with a plain Knative `Build`, the other using a `BuildTemplate`.
First, you need to have Knative installed.
Please refer to the link:../../../INSTALL.adoc#knative[installation instructions] for the options you have for installing Knative build

Both examples require a registry to push the created image into.
For the simplicities sake, we install an insecure and unprotected registry directly into the current namespace.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f registry.yml
----

This registry is only available within from the current namespace as `registry`.
Of course, feel free to adapt the examples below to use another registry which is more accessible than that.

=== Simple Build

To start a simple build with the https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib Maven Plugin]
you create the build with

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f build-with-jib.yml
----

As always, you might want to have a look into the descriptor, it contains some useful comments.

To monitor the build check the pods:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods

NAME                                    READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
random-generator-with-jib-pod-b68481   0/1     Init:1/3   0          7s
registry-59df4ddcdc-jhkdg               1/1     Running    0          42s
----

and the logs

[source]
----
kubectl logs random-generator-with-jib-pod-b68481 -c build-step-build-and-push

In order to deploy see this application, see below.

=== Build Template

As alternative you can build the application with a `BuildTemplate`.

First, install the template:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f maven-kaniko-buildtemplate.yml
----

You can verify the template with

[source]
----
kubectl get buildtemplate
NAME           AGE
maven-kaniko   7s
----

Now start the build which uses this template:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f build-with-template.yml
----

You can watch the progress of the build with

[source]
----
kubectl get pods
NAME                                    READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
random-generator-with-template-pod-0ae221    0/1     Completed   0          1m

kubectl logs random-generator-with-template-pod-0ae221 -c build-step-maven-build
.....
kubectl logs random-generator-with-template-pod-0ae221 -c build-step-image-build-and-push
.....
----

=== Deploy application

When you have build the random-generator with one of the methods above, you can deploy it easily.
Unfortunately, for picking up images, Kubernetes (or at least Minikube) doesn't support service DNS lookups in the `image:` field of a container specification.

So we need to insert the IP adress directly which you can do while deploying, like in:

[source, bash]
----
cat random-generator-deploy.yml | \
  sed -e "s/registry:80/$(kubectl get svc registry -o jsonpath={.spec.clusterIP}):80/" | \
  kubectl create -f -
----

This will also install an `Ingress` object which allows you access the service easily from outside the cluster.
If you are testing with Minikube, you should be sure that you have the Ingress addon enabled with `minikube addons enable ingress` before deploying the application.

On Minikube you then access the service with

[source, bash]
----
curl -sL http://random-service.$(minikube ip).nip.io | jq .
